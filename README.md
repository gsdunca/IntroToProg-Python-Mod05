# IntroToProg-Python-Mod05
Hi, I am a beginning student in an intro to Python programing course.
This repository was created an exercise in one of our assignments.
Due to the increase negative "Trolling" on the internet these days I don’t see this profile being around any longer than is necessary.
If you are here, please be kind and don’t dump any unwanted files in my repository. 
that includes using this as a hub to share any files that may be deemed illegal or malicious.

have a splendid day.
